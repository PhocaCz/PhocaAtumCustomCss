# Install

Copy the user.css file from this package into your Joomla 5 Atum administration template, in the following folder:

- media/templates/administrator/atum/css/

Attention, if the user.css file already exists in this folder, it is possible that you already have some custom changes in this template.
Before overwriting the old file, check these changes so you don't lose them.

# Uninstallation

Just delete the user.css file from your Joomla 5 Atum administration template.
Always backup your files before deleting.
